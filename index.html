            <h3>Food Insecurity</h3>
            <p> The inability to afford healthy food for all family members has had a substantial increase during the covid 
            pandemic due to umeployment.  This has always been an issue of income inequality.   In an effort to address 
            the needs of a growing hungry population our team has gathered information and resources related to where to get food,
            how to access food related services, growing food through gardening, and cooking on a budget.
            </p>
            <p>This project was created as a part of Hack the Culture in an effort to be a part of change for the good of all people.</p>
